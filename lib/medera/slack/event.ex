defmodule Medera.Slack.Event do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents an event we receive from Slack

  An Event struct always contains the original payload from Slack in the
  payload field.  Some fields are "promoted" to the top level of the struct
  if they are present:

  * `type` - The event type
  * `user` - Slack user id
  * `channel` - Slack channel id (may be a direct message)
  * `payload` - The original struct recieved

  The following fields may be prepopulated if they were available and
  applicable:
  * `human_user` - Human-readable user name
  * `human_channel` - Human-readable channel
  * `direct_message` - `true` if the event was a direct message
